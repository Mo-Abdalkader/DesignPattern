# Behavioral Design Patterns

Welcome to the Behavioral Design Patterns section! Here, you will find explanations and examples of various behavioral patterns used in software design.

## What are Behavioral Design Patterns?

Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, defining how objects interact and distribute responsibilities. They emphasize flexibility in assigning behaviors between objects and classes.

### Patterns Included

This section covers the following behavioral patterns:

1. **Observer Pattern:**
   - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - [Read more about Observer Pattern](01-Observer.md)

2. **Strategy Pattern:**
   - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
   - [Read more about Strategy Pattern](02-Strategy.md)

3. **Template Method Pattern:**
   - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.
   - [Read more about Template Method Pattern](03-Template-Method.md)

4. **Command Pattern:**
   - Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

5. **Iterator Pattern:**
   - Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
   - [Read more about Iterator Pattern](05-Iterator.md)

6. **Mediator Pattern:**
   - Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows their interaction to vary independently.

7. **Memento Pattern:**
   - Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo operation).
   - [Read more about Memento Pattern](07-Memento.md)

8. **State Pattern:**
   - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
   - [Read more about State Pattern](08-State.md)

9. **Visitor Pattern:**
   - Defines a new operation to a set of objects without changing the objects themselves. It allows adding new behaviors to existing object structures.
