# Design Patterns

This repository contains examples and explanations of various design patterns commonly used in software development. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design, providing a structured approach to solve common challenges.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to typical problems that arise in software design. They represent guidelines and templates to help developers create elegant and maintainable software systems. Using design patterns promotes code reusability, scalability, and flexibility.

### Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are categorized into three main types:

1. **Creational Patterns:**
   - Focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in creating objects while hiding the creation logic.
   - Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

2. **Structural Patterns:**
   - Address how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, simplifying the relationships between entities.
   - Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy.

3. **Behavioral Patterns:**
   - Manage algorithms, responsibilities, and communication between objects, enhancing flexibility and communication.
   - Examples: Observer, Strategy, Template Method, Command, Iterator, State.

## Contents

This repository includes implementations and explanations for each type of design pattern:

- **Creational Patterns**
  - Singleton
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Prototype

- **Structural Patterns**
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Proxy

- **Behavioral Patterns**
  - Observer

Each pattern folder contains:

- **Explanation:** Overview of the pattern, its intent, motivation, and applicability.
- **Implementation:** Code examples in Java (and possibly other languages) demonstrating how the pattern can be implemented.
- **Usage:** Practical scenarios and considerations for applying the pattern effectively.

## How to Use

You can explore each design pattern by navigating to its respective folder. Each folder contains a detailed README.md file with explanations, code examples, and usage considerations.
