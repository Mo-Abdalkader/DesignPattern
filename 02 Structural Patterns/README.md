# Structural Design Patterns

Welcome to the Structural Design Patterns section! Here, you will find explanations and examples of various structural patterns used in software design.

## What are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural design patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, providing flexible ways to realize relationships between entities while keeping the system organized.

### Patterns Included

This section covers the following structural patterns:

1. **Adapter Pattern:**
   - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper that translates one interface into another.
   - [Read more about Adapter Pattern](01-Adapter.md)

2. **Bridge Pattern:**
   - Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
   - [Read more about Bridge Pattern](02-Bridge.md)

3. **Composite Pattern:**
   - Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly, allowing a client to treat objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
   - [Read more about Composite Pattern](03-Composite.md)

4. **Decorator Pattern:**
   - Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.
   - [Read more about Decorator Pattern](04-Decorator.md)

5. **Facade Pattern:**
   - Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying the usage for clients.
   - [Read more about Facade Pattern](05-Facade.md)

6. **Proxy Pattern:**
   - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
   - [Read more about Proxy Pattern](06-Proxy.md)
